                <h3>The following list is a time line of Onassis Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>613</strong> - For three years after the birth of Islam, Muslims kept their faith secret. In 613, according to Islamic tradition, Muhammad was commanded by God to call people to Islam openly</li>
                    <li><strong>617</strong> - In 617, the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the Banu Hashim. Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim, were cut off in a pass away from Mecca</li>
                    <li><strong>622</strong> - In 622, on the invitation of the Muslims of Medina, Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina.</li>
                    <li><strong>624</strong> - In 624, Abu Bakr was involved in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In relation to this, Ali allegedly later asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men.</li>
